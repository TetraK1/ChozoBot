# Changelog
  - **0.995a - December 14, 2020**
    - Increased length of room_time and afk_time for the users table
      - For existing databases, run `ALTER TABLE SCHEMA.users ALTER COLUMN room_time TYPE DECIMAL(13,3);` and again for the column `afk_time`. Be sure to replace SCHEMA with whatever your schema is called, which is usually your room's name.
      - Fixes room times hitting the upper limit within a few months' time.
  - **0.994a - November 8, 2020**
    - Add hyphen (-) to blacklistvid ID regex
  - **0.993a - October 3, 2020**
    - Changed the config option `misc.autoAFK` to a tri-state option. Must be updated in existing configs, or it will be ignored.
      - 0: Off (default)
      - 1: Always AFK
      - 2: Always active
    - `ipban` reason will be padded if it begins with `wrange` or `range`
    - Actually use the `exitCode` passed to `bot.kill` (lol)
    - DB features will be disabled if the connection to the database is refused
