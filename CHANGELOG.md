# Changelog
  - **0.996a - October 21, 2021**
    - Added bot.queueMedia function to allow the bot to add things to the queue
      - This doesn't have any command associated with it, though. It's there if you'd like to make your own commands. There's a little JSDoc thing above the function definition for reference.
      - An example for adding a simple temporary YouTube video would be: `bot.queueMedia("end", "youtube_video_url", true);`
        - You can also use `"next"` instead of `"end"` to place it next in the queue assuming the bot has permission to.
      - Custom embeds should work too. `bot.queueMedia("end", "customembed", true, "<iframe src='source or whatever'>", "Media Title");`
    - Added `cfg.connection.sameDomainSocketOnly` option to the config, please add this to any existing configs if you need to. It will default to `true` if it does not exist.
      - Only set this to `false` if you need to connect to a socket that does not live on the domain your CyTube fork is on.
      - As far as I know, this is only relevant for some CyTube hosts, and not the main CyTube site.
    - Logged media links (such as "now playing" logs) will have the full link instead of the shortened one
    - Fixed dumb Discord bot oversight causing it to crash for those who use it (probably no one)
    - Removed some room-specific emotes and filters from some commands
      - Probably missed some, oops
    - Added `/mute` and `/unmute` commands to the CLI, which work exactly the same as their chat command counterparts
    - Added the ability for `sendChatMsg` to bypass the mute state, which the CLI command `/say` now does (this is the only command that does so by default)
    - Added some clarification to some comments
    - Now prevents invalid requests to update emote counts if the user is unregistered or a guest and guest data is off
      - Didn't do anything other than spam DB errors
    - Fixed a regular expression used for some wolfram responses
    - Queue fail and queue warn logs should now properly display their messages
    - Fixed issue when chat message was missing from the chatMsg frame
      - This issue is only related to certain forks
    - Updated license dates
  - **0.9951a - January 24, 2021**
    - Fixed a rare bug with chat messages sent by the server
  - **0.995a - December 14, 2020**
    - Increased length of room_time and afk_time for the users table
      - For existing databases, run `ALTER TABLE SCHEMA.users ALTER COLUMN room_time TYPE DECIMAL(13,3);` and again for the column `afk_time`. Be sure to replace SCHEMA with whatever your schema is called, which is usually your room's name.
      - Fixes room times hitting the upper limit within a few months' time.
  - **0.994a - November 8, 2020**
    - Add hyphen (-) to blacklistvid ID regex
  - **0.993a - October 3, 2020**
    - Changed the config option `misc.autoAFK` to a tri-state option. Must be updated in existing configs, or it will be ignored.
      - 0: Off (default)
      - 1: Always AFK
      - 2: Always active
    - `ipban` reason will be padded if it begins with `wrange` or `range`
    - Actually use the `exitCode` passed to `bot.kill` (lol)
    - DB features will be disabled if the connection to the database is refused
